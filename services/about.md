In kubernetes, a service is an entity that represents a set of pods running an application or functional component.
The service holds access policies, and is responsible for enforcing these policies for incoming request.


in simple words, a service is a method to expose our application that is running on pods .

The service api, part of kubernetes, is an abstraction to help expose groups of Pods over a network.
